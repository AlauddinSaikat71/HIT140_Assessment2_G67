To run the Python code in VS Code, follow these steps:

Steps to Run Python Code in VS Code:

1. Install VS Code:

If you donâ€™t already have Visual Studio Code installed, download it from here.

2. Install Python:

If you don't have Python installed, download and install Python from here.
Make sure to check the option to Add Python to PATH during installation.

3. Install Python Extension for VS Code:

Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon (or press Ctrl + Shift + X).
Search for Python and install the official extension from Microsoft.

4. Open or Create a Python File:

Open VS Code, and go to File > Open Folder to open the folder where your project is saved.
Inside the folder, create a new file with a .py extension (e.g., project_analysis.py).
Copy and paste the full Python code I provided into this file.

5. Install Required Python Libraries:

Open the terminal in VS Code by selecting Terminal > New Terminal (or press Ctrl + Shift + ).
Run the following commands to install the necessary libraries (if not already installed):
    `pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy`

6. Run the Python Code:

In VS Code, open your Python file (project_analysis.py).
Press F5 or right-click inside the editor and select Run Python File in Terminal.
Alternatively, you can run the file directly in the terminal:
    `python project_analysis.py`

7. View the Output:

The output of the code (descriptive statistics, correlation, t-test results) will be printed in the Terminal.
Visualizations (box plots, histograms) will pop up in separate windows.
